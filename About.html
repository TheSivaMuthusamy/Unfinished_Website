               <p>I created this website in an attempt to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. With that being said, the website is in a state of WIP. Features will continued to be added when I have time to write them, including some server-side stuff like comments or posts. Style and Layout are also subject to change depending on ease of use.</p>
               <p>Despite this, I do wish to host some sort of content on this website. What type of content? Most likely a mish-mash of topics. That would seem to go well with the website of having bologna in its name. Perhaps as the website gets older, it will develop some sort of focus. Don't care at this point though.</p>
